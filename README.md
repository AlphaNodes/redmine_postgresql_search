Redmine PostgreSQL Search [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AlphaNodes/redmine_postgresql_search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlphaNodes/redmine_postgresql_search) ![Run RuboCop](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_postgresql_search/workflows/Run%20RuboCop/badge.svg)

=========================

Makes Redmine search use PostgreSQL full text search instead of LIKE queries.
PostgreSQL 9.6 or above is required.

Installation
------------

The [additionals](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/additionals) plugin is needed for this plugin.
Install it first if you don't use it yet.

Follow the generic [Redmine plugin installation
instructions](https://redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Plugins), but with a
twist for Redmine installations with mostly non-english content:

_Before_ running the plugin migrations, set the `language` environment variable
to the language your Redmine content (mostly) is in. The `setup_tsearch`
migration uses this to create a matching [text search
configuration](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/textsearch-intro.html#TEXTSEARCH-INTRO-CONFIGURATIONS)
in your Redmine database.  This directly influences search results quality so
don't just skip this (unless your language would be english, this is the
default used by the migration).

To find out which languages are supported by your PostgreSQL installation, run
`\dF` in a shell:

    redmine=# \dF
                    List of text search configurations
       Schema   |     Name     |              Description
    ------------+--------------+---------------------------------------
     pg_catalog | danish       | configuration for danish language
     pg_catalog | dutch        | configuration for dutch language
     pg_catalog | english      | configuration for english language
     pg_catalog | finnish      | configuration for finnish language
     pg_catalog | french       | configuration for french language
     pg_catalog | german       | configuration for german language
     pg_catalog | hungarian    | configuration for hungarian language
     pg_catalog | italian      | configuration for italian language
     pg_catalog | norwegian    | configuration for norwegian language
     pg_catalog | portuguese   | configuration for portuguese language
     pg_catalog | romanian     | configuration for romanian language
     pg_catalog | russian      | configuration for russian language
     pg_catalog | simple       | simple configuration
     pg_catalog | spanish      | configuration for spanish language
     pg_catalog | swedish      | configuration for swedish language
     pg_catalog | turkish      | configuration for turkish language

So if your Redmine installation has mostly German text, you would run

    language=german bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate

after unpacking the plugin to `YOUR_REDMINE/plugins/redmine_postgresql_search`.

After running the migrations, make sure to index all your existing content by running

    bundle exec rake redmine_postgresql_search:rebuild_index


In case you want to learn more about the internals of PostgreSQL full text
search - I found these two articles quite helpful:

- http://linuxgazette.net/164/sephton.html

### Extensions

The `setup_tsearch` migration attempts to install the _unaccent_ and _pg\_trgm_
PostgreSQL extensions, which may fail due to insufficient privileges of your
application's database user. To get around this, set up the extensions manually
(`create extension unaccent`, `create extension pg_trgm`) using a privileged user
account and re-run the plugin migrations.
On Ubuntu/Debian the extensions are part of the `postgresql-contrib` package.

Known Issues
------------

Please report any issues not mentioned here [on
Github](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_postgresql_search/issues).

### Result Completeness

Search on custom fields and journal entries is done separately from search in
issues - therefore a search for all words of the query `foo bar` will not find
issues with `foo` in the description and `bar` in a journal entry or custom
field.  The reason is the way Redmine search works on a fundamental level.  To
make things a little better this plugin indexes the issue's subject along with
each journal, so if you have `foo` in the subject and `bar` in a journal entry
you will find the issue.
